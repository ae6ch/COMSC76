Create a new concrete class that implements MyMap (Listing 27.1) using open addressing with quadratic probing. For simplicity, use f(key) = key % size as the hash function, where size is the hash-table size. Initially, the hash-table size is 4. The table size is doubled whenever the load factor exceeds the threshold (0.5). Write a driver program to test your class.
