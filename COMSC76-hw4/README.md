(Sort ArrayList) Write the following method that sorts an ArrayList:

    public static <E extends Comparable<E>>

        void sort(ArrayList<E> list)
This sort method should contain a for loop. 

Write a program to test the method with three different arrays:

Integers: 2, 4, and 3;

Doubles: 3.4, 1.2, and -12.3; 

Strings: "Bob", "Alice", "Ted", and "Carol"

This program is similar to the Case Study in the book: Sorting an Array of Objects

 

The following illustrates how the output should appear:

Sorted Integer Objects: 2 3 4

Sorted Double Objects: -12.3 1.2 3.4

Sorted String Objects: Alice Bob Carol Ted
