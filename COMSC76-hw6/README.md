(Count the occurrences of words in a text file) Rewrite Listing 21.9 to read the text from a text file. The text file is passed as a command-line argument. Words are delimited by whitespace characters, punctuation marks (, ; . : ?), quotation marks (' "), and parentheses. Count the words in a case-insensitive fashion (e.g., consider Good and good to be the same word). The words must start with a letter. Display the output of words in alphabetical order, with each word preceded by the number of times it occurs. 

I ran my program solution with this sample_text.txt Download sample_text.txt as the input file in order to generate the following sample output:
