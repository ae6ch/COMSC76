As the sun? nears the peak of its current solar cycle, our star is growing
increasingly active. And that peak may be occurring sooner than predicted,
according to scientists.
Every 11 years or so, the (sun) experiences periods of low and high solar
activity, which is associated with the amount of sunspots on "its" surface.
These dark regions, some of which can reach the size of 'Earth' or larger,
are driven by the (sunâ€™s) strong and constantly shifting magnetic fields.
