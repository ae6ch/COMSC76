Start by carefully reading Listing 24.5: MyLinkedList.java (on page 938 of the 11th Edition of the text). Note that the listing is incomplete. Your assignment is to implement a revised MyLinkedList class after you have included all the code needed to fill in and complete all the methods that were omitted. Next, write a (main) driver program that initializes a linked list with 10 names (your choice), and then completely tests every one of its methods of ensure that the class meets all its requirements.

Note: These are the 12 methods you need to implement AND test

addFirst
addLast
add
removeFirst
removeLast
remove
contains
get
indexOf
lastIndexOf
set
remove in LinkedListIterator
Please remember that in your driver program/main method, you have to test all of these methods. I will be looking to see whether all these methods are used in your driver program.
